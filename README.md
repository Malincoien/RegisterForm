# RegisterForm
Had some issues with my php extension, it should work fine but if not then plese let me know!

I found it best to display the error messages in javascript as i was able to make a eventListener so that the message would disappear when the field was empty/the value was 0

There are some errors in the code so please give feedback if anything is malfunctioning or if something is incorrect.
